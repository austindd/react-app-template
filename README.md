# React-App-Template

A minimal set of configurations and modules to quickly start a new React project.

The package currently includes the core React libraries, Babel, Webpack (configured for ESLint, JSX, Sass, PostCSS, and more).

This project is still a work in progress. More documentation will be added soon. Please let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement!
