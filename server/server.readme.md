# Servers

React-App-Template is unopinionated when it comes to server frameworks, and no server-specific modules are installed by default. Instead, we provide instructions on how to integrate several popular server frameworks. Check the other `readme` files in this directory for details.

Do your own thing. Or someone else's thing. We won't stop you either way.
